same process of drawing your layout first, then choosing the appropriate HTML elements to markup the document and then
 apply your CSS.

Don't be afraid to Google stuff and/or ask questions.

You are also encouraged to try stuff out, experiment - what if I did this or that or the other.  Compare and contrast
and check your work cross browser.
